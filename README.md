# Group COO – Operational Control Dashboard (Power BI)

This repository showcases a **Group COO–style monthly operational governance dashboard** built in Power BI.

The dashboard is designed to support **executive oversight, exception management, and escalation** across:
- Delivery performance
- Operational risk (Sev 1 / Sev 2 incidents)
- Capacity risk
- Control effectiveness and overdue actions

---

## Executive Use Case
This dashboard mirrors how Group COO / ExCo packs are used in large UK organisations:
- Monthly snapshot (latest month only for KPIs)
- Clear RAG status by function
- Rolling risk trend for early warning
- Auto-generated executive narrative focused on **exceptions and required action**

---

## What This Demonstrates
- Executive KPI design (not analyst-level charts)
- Correct handling of **latest-month vs cumulative metrics**
- RAG logic aligned to governance thresholds
- Drill-through–ready dimensional modelling
- Accessibility-aware design (colour + text cues)
