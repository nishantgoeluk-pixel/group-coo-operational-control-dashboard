Group COO – Operational Control Dashboard (Power BI)

This repository showcases a Group COO–style monthly operational control dashboard built in Power BI.

The dashboard is designed to support executive oversight, exception management and escalation across core operational risk areas:

Delivery performance

Operational risk (Sev 1 / Sev 2 incidents)

Capacity risk

Control effectiveness and overdue actions

Executive use case

This dashboard mirrors how Group COO and ExCo packs are typically used in large UK organisations.

It provides:

A clear monthly snapshot, with headline KPIs fixed to the latest reporting period

RAG status by function to highlight where action is required

A rolling operational risk trend to provide early warning

An executive summary focused on exceptions and required escalation

The intent is not exploration or deep analysis, but fast, confident decision-making at executive level.

What this demonstrates

Executive-level KPI design rather than analyst-style reporting

Clear separation of latest-month KPIs versus rolling trends

Consistent RAG logic aligned to governance thresholds

Star-schema dimensional modelling suitable for drill-through and scale

Accessible design using restrained colour and text cues
