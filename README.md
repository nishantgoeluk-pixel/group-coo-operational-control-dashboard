# Group COO – Operational Control Dashboard (Power BI)

This repository showcases a Group COO style monthly operational control dashboard built in Power BI.

The dashboard is designed to support executive oversight, exception management and escalation across:
- Delivery performance
- Operational risk (Sev 1 / Sev 2 incidents)
- Capacity risk
- Control effectiveness and overdue actions

---

## Executive use case

This dashboard mirrors how Group COO and ExCo packs are typically used in large UK organisations.

It provides:
- A clear monthly snapshot (latest month only for headline KPIs)
- RAG status by function to highlight where action is required
- A rolling operational risk trend for early warning
- An executive summary focused on exceptions and required escalation

The intent is not exploration or deep analysis, but fast, confident decision-making at executive level.

---

## What this demonstrates

- Executive-level KPI design rather than analyst reporting
- Correct separation of latest-month KPIs vs rolling trends
- Consistent RAG logic aligned to governance thresholds
- Dimensional modelling suitable for drill-through and scale
- Accessible design using colour and text cues
